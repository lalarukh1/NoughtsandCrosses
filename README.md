<h3> A java based tic-tac-toe game </h3>

<p> This game was made as a part of a Beginner Masters module project for Learning Java from scratch. </p>
<p> A test driven approach was implemented during development and all the core concepts of object oriented programming such as inheritence,
polymorphism, encapsulation etc were learnt through their application in the code.</p>
